				<p class="body">While many creators on Tiktok rise to fame through their dance, music, or comedic videos, one woman recently amassed millions of fans for her videos on single motherhood.</p>

				<p class="body">Maia Knight, 24, posts daily TikTok of the realities of single motherhood, from her exhaustion and mess to the growth milestones of her twin daughters. Her transparent content has earned her 5,000,000 on the platform.</p>

				<p class="body">Maia Knight’s frankness in showing her role as a mother began with a  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maiaknight/video/7014462719323639046">TikTok</a> highlighting her accidental pregnancy and the complications that followed, including the fact that the father of her twin daughters leaving at seven weeks.</p>

				<p class="body">For the average viewer, she may seem like she makes nothing more than daily vlogs, the popular <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/723192/what-is-a-vlog-and-why-is-everyone-on-youtube-vlogging/">video style</a> that has dominated the Internet in the last five years.</p>

				<p class="body">But there’s something uniquely <i>real</i> about her content, as she uploads videos without leaving any of the details out.</p>

				<p class="body">“You can tell she really loves her kids. I was initially hooked by how cute the babies are, but stuck around because even though it seems tiring, it still looks fun and exciting,” said Zoe Rennock, a fan of Knight’s content.</p>

				<p class="body">For many fans, she’s also changing the narrative of what it means to be a single mother in this century. In some of her <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdjskWWd/">content</a>, Knight drops her daughters off at her mother’s house, then goes out with her best friend, Jillian, to local bars. </p>

				<p class="body">Few young single mothers can be seen doing <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdjsNjhy/">walk of shames</a>, especially so publically on the internet, without receiving criticism. Yet regardless of her comment section, Knight shows her audience that she can raise 8-month-old babies while still having fun on the weekends.</p>

				<p class="body">This is a refreshing type of representation to see in the media, helping to destigmatize the often villainized single mother, who stands at the unfortunate intersection of purity culture and the financial gender disparity.</p>

				<p class="body">Existing outside the traditional two-parent family model, the single mother often must face the assumptions that come with an unattributed baby bump.</p>

				<p class="body">Misogynistic stereotypes link unplanned pregnancy to promiscuity, foolishness, or deserving of the consequences of these women’s actions, often neglecting the role the man plays in an accidental pregnancy.</p>

				<p class="body">Beyond the whispered comments, there are huge economic and educational disparities that single mothers face in this country.</p>

				<p class="body">Despite the much larger percentage of women raising children on their own, there is a huge wage gap between single women and men in this country, with single men earning up to $11,000 more than single women on average.</p>

				<p class="body">This alone already puts women at a disadvantage, not to mention the additional income another adult figure would provide in the household, over $80,000 on average, according to the same survey.</p>

				<p class="body">Some of this income disparity is the result of the huge gap in education between women that just had a kid in the last 12 months. According to the American Community Survey, just above 1 out of every 10 unmarried mothers completes a Bachelors’s degree or higher, compared to almost half of the married mothers. </p>
	
				<p class="body">One single mother, Natalia Moreno, has two master’s degrees.</p>

				<p class="body">Moreno said she completed the first degree as she was pregnant with her daughter, and the second when her daughter was around 10 or 11.</p> 

				<p class="body">When she was completing her second degree, she said, “It took me a little longer. Instead of one year like I thought I could do, it took a year and a half because I couldn’t keep up.”</p>

				<p class="body">She detailed the long readings and late nights, describing the classwork as a full-time job. Nevertheless, Moreno completed her second degree, even if it took her longer to do so.

				<p class="body">Moreno also described the ways in which her role as a single mom was received in her community.</p>

				<p class="body">“As a single person who is embedded in the community of parents, like the school, they’re very nice to you when you’re with the kid but you’re not invited to any of the things the parents do together,” Moreno said.</p>

				<p class="body">Although her backlash stopped at a community level, young TikTok Mother Maia Knight has the added vulnerability of having an entire following watching her every move.</p>

				<p class="body">And being so open about her relationships and choices she makes with her kids, she has received her fair share of hate comments. </p>

				<p class="body">In one video, she broke the news to her audience that she had ended things with her most recent boyfriend, and asked they didn’t investigate him further. In another, she responded to many comments criticizing her for not dressing her kids warm enough for the winter. </p>

				<p class="body">AAnother fan, McKenzie Hagenbuch, agrees that gaining Tiktok fame through single motherhood is not as easy as it seems.</p>

				<p class="body">“She’s now on a pedestal. To many this might look like an advantageous position to help others, but really, being a large influence in the public eye and being a role model are not synonymous,” Hagenbuch said. </p>

				<p class="body">Regardless of her intentions on TikTok or how her content is received, Maia Knight is helping to change perceptions of being a single mom, and like other things in her life, she’s doing it all on her own.</p>
