        <p>
            My name is Isabel Meara! I am a sophomore studying Broadcast & Digital Journalism and Information Management & Technology. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I’m interested in being a <strong>video editor</strong> for Vox or another news site and I am pursuing technology to develop some practical skills for future projects, such as web design, MS Excel, basic development, and data analytics.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            I have been on Dean’s List for the three semesters that I have been here, and I have completed projects utilizing HTML/CSS and Python. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have proficiency in:
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
            <li>Adobe Premiere</li>
            <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
             In my free time, I love to craft! I have a yearly yearbook in which I print hundreds of photos, and glue them onto cardstock that I decorate and encompasses each year of school. I’ve been doing this since Junior Year of high school. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I also love music, movies, and TV. My most recent show was Killing Eve, then Euphoria. I like to listen to a bunch of genres of music, with my favorite artists being Faye Webster and Mitski, but lately I have been listening to a lot of rap, soul, techno/house, and folk. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I usually come up with complex plans to entertain myself, so when the first quarantine of 2020 hit, I have never worked on more projects in my life. I took up album reviewing, poster design, blogging, self-photography, and watched many movies. In general, I like to exercise creativity and have a deep curiosity for the world.
