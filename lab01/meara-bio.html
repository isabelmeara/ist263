    </head>


    <body>
        My name is Isabel Meara! I am a sophomore studying Broadcast & Digital Journalism and Information Management & Technology. I’m interested in being a video editor for Vox or another news site and I am pursuing technology to develop some practical skills for future projects, such as web design, MS Excel, basic development, and data analytics. I have been on Dean’s List for the three semesters that I have been here, I have completed projects utilizing HTML/CSS and Python, and I have proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Premiere, and Illustrator. In my free time, I love to craft! I have a yearly yearbook in which I print hundreds of photos, and glue them onto cardstock that I decorate and encompasses each year of school. I’ve been doing this since Junior Year of high school. I also love music, movies, and TV. My most recent show was Killing Eve, then Euphoria. I like to listen to a bunch of genres of music, with my favorite artists being Faye Webster and Mitski, but lately I have been listening to a lot of raps, including A Tribe Called Quest, Madlib, and Freddie Gibbs. I usually come up with complex plans to entertain myself, so when the first quarantine of 2020 hit, I have never worked on more projects in my life. I took up album reviewing, poster design, blogging, self-photography, and watched many movies. In general, I like to exercise creativity and have a deep curiosity for the world.
